# PCA-for-spectral templates : Generating Spectral Templates for CCSNe using Dimensionality Reduction

[![Python 3.10.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10.5-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)

'PCA-for-spectral templates' is a repo for generating spectral templates of Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe). We are currently trying to optimize the dimensionality reduction of spectral sequence of CCSNe in order to save computational time for using them on Neutral Networks later on. 

The codes just began development in May 2023.
