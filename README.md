# PCA-for-spectral templates : Generating Spectral Templates for CCSNe using Machine Learning

[![Python 3.10.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10.5-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)

'PCA-for-spectral templates' is a repo for generating spectral templates of Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) using archival data from [WiseRep](https://www.wiserep.org/) and Machine Learning techniques. We are currently trying to optimize dimensionality reduction (using PC/AutoEncoders) of spectral sequence of CCSNe in order to save computational time for using them on Neutral Networks later on. 

The codes just began development in May 2023.
